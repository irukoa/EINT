.TH EINT 1

.SH NAME

eint - Numerically integrate data employing the extrapolation method.

.SH SYNOPSIS

eint [OPTION(S)]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Numerically integrate data employing the extrapolation (a.k.a. Romberg integration) method.

EINT computes integrals of the form I = \\frac{1}{b-a}\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx, using the extrapolation (a.k.a. Romberg integration) method. We assume that the [a, b] interval is discretised as x_i = a + (b-a)\\frac{i-1}{N-1} = a + (i-1)h : i\\in[1, N], and that the array of values {f(x_i): i\\in[1, N]} is known. We call N the number of discretisation points, and h the "step size". EINT returns the integral I after entering the array of values {f(x_i)}.

The accuracy of the method depends on N. Given a prime factorisation of N-1, N-1 = 2^{n_2}3^{n_3}\\cdots, the extrapolation method can be applied with an arbitrary prime base p. If p^{n_p} is a factor of N-1, then the expected accuracy of the result will be \\mathcal{O}(h^{2n_p}).

The program processes space- or comma-separated CSV files.

The program considers each column j of the CSV file as a discretisation of the function f_j(x). If the option -t is specified, the program will consider each row i of the CSV file as a discretisation of the function f_i(x) instead.

.SH OPTIONS

Usage: eint [-v] [-h] [-b BASE] [-f FILE] [-t] [-c BUFFER_SIZE]

-v,                    : print version and verbose option.

-h,                    : print help and exit.

-b, BASE               : extrapolation base, a prime number > 1. Default is 2.
                         Works best with the smallest or most degenerate divisor of N-1.

-f, FILE               : process specified file.

-t,                    : integrate row by row instead of column by column.

The next arguments are useful for processing large CSV files.

-c, BUFFER_SIZE        : a custom maximum column size for reading CSV files. Must be > 65536 (the default value).

.SH EXAMPLE

Integrate f(x) = x from 0 to 1, using N = 5 = 2^2 - 1.

>$ echo "0.0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1.0" | eint -t

5.0000000000e-01
